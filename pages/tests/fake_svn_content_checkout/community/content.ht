The Python Community
--------------------

The `Python Software Foundation <../psf/>`__
and the global Python community welcome and encourage participation
by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and
encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these
principles.

To get you started, we've put together a list of resources:

- `Diversity Statement <diversity>`__:  We want our community to be more varied, expressed in our diversity statement; whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.
- `Conferences and Workshops </community/workshops>`_
- `Python Community Awards </community/awards>`_
- `Special Interest Groups (SIGS) </community/sigs>`_
- `Internet Relay Chat (IRC) </community/irc>`_
- `Logos </community/logos>`_
- `Jobs </community/jobs>`_
- `Python T-Shirts and other merchandise </community/merchandise/>`_
  (sales benefit the `Python Software Foundation </psf/>`_)
