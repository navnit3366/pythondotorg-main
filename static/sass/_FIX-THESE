BIG ISSUE: Touch devices need a better way to navigate the large top-level menu. Off canvas (drawer) might be the best option. Drop downs are too clunky and not reliable. 

Simplify the way that most columns work -- remove dependency on Susy. 
Won't be able to do this easily for the header banners because of the push/pull percent margins and paddings. 

Blockquotes should not have a FOOTER element inside of them. Change markup and associated CSS. Fix also .success-stories-widget and .success-quote.

Make the breakpoints in layout.scss work on variables. Easier to change in one place than in both the layout and mq files. 

Convert the .list-row-container ULs/OLs to use table-row and table-cell display properties? Test in IE. Benefits? Maybe none.
