The Agreement may be terminated (i) by either Party for any reason upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other Party; (ii) if one Party notifies the other Party that the other Party is in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and such breach (if curable) is not cured with fifteen (15) days of such notice; (iii) if both Parties agree to terminate by mutual written consent; or (iv) if any of Sponsor information is found or is reasonably alleged to violate the rights of a third party.  The PSF shall also have the unilateral right to terminate this Agreement at any time if it reasonably determines that it would be detrimental to the reputation and goodwill of the PSF or the Programs to continue to accept or use funds from Sponsor.

  <li><span class="item-title">Representations and Warranties</span>.  Each Party represents and warrants for the benefit of the other Party that it has the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and is able to comply with the terms herein.  Sponsor represents and warrants for the benefit of the PSF that it has full right and title to the Sponsor Intellectual Property to be provided under this Agreement and is not under any obligation to any party that restricts the Sponsor Intellectual Property or would prevent Sponsor’s performance under this Agreement.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Successors and Assigns</span>.  This Agreement and all the terms and provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors, and/or assigns.

  <li><span class="item-title">Severability</span>.  If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Party waives any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Confidential Information</span>.  As used herein, “<b>Confidential Information</b>” means all confidential information disclosed by a Party (“<b>Disclosing Party</b>”) to the other Party (“<b>Receiving Party</b>”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information.  Each Party agrees: (a) to observe complete confidentiality with respect to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (b) not to disclose, or permit any third party or entity access to disclose, the Confidential Information (or any portion thereof) of the Disclosing Party without prior written permission of Disclosing Party; and (c) to ensure that any employees, or any third parties who receive access to the Confidential Information, are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature thereof and are prohibited from disclosing the Confidential Information and using the Confidential Information other than for the benefit of the Receiving Party in accordance with this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind, but in no event less than reasonable care.  Neither Party shall have any liability with respect to Confidential Information to the extent such information: (w) is or becomes publicly available (other than through a breach of this Agreement); (x) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Receiving Party (after such inquiry as would be reasonable in the circumstances) to be the subject of a confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (y) is developed by the Receiving Party independently and without reference to information provided by the Disclosing Party; or (z) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Independent Contractors</span>.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute or be construed as the creation of any partnership, agency, or joint venture relationship between the Parties.  Neither of the Parties shall have the right to obligate or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall give or is intended to give any rights of any kind to any third party.  The relationship of the Parties shall be as independent contractors.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Indemnification</span>. Sponsor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the PSF, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, for any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs (including costs associated with any official investigations or inquiries) and other expenses, incurred on account of Sponsor’s acts or omissions in connection with the performance of this Agreement or breach of this Agreement or with respect to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or dissemination of any of Sponsor’s products or services. The PSF shall have no liability to Sponsor with respect to its participation in this Agreement or receipt of the Sponsorship Payment, except for intentional or willful acts of the PSF or its employees or agents. The rights and responsibilities established in this section shall survive indefinitely beyond the term of this Agreement.</li>

  <p>Acknowledgments of appreciation for the Sponsorship Payment may identify and briefly describe Sponsor and its products or product lines in neutral terms and may include Sponsor’s name, logo, well-established slogan, locations, telephone numbers, or website addresses, but such acknowledgments shall not include (a) comparative or qualitative descriptions of Sponsor’s products, services, or facilities; (b) price information or other indications of savings or value associated with Sponsor’s products or services; (c) a call to action; (d) an endorsement; or (e) an inducement to buy, sell, or use Sponsor’s products or services.  Any such acknowledgments will be created, or subject to prior review and approval, by the PSF.</p>

  <p>The PSF’s acknowledgment may include the following:</p>

  <ol>
      <li>Display of Logo. The PSF will display Sponsor’s logo and other agreed-upon identifying information on www.python.org, and on any marketing and promotional media made by the PSF in connection with the Programs, solely for the purpose of acknowledging Sponsor as a sponsor of the Programs in a manner (placement, form, content, etc.) reasonably determined by the PSF in its sole discretion.  Sponsor agrees to provide all the necessary content and materials for use in connection with such display.</li>

      <li>[Other use or Acknowledgement.]</li>
   </ol>

The Sponsorship Payment is due within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. To the extent that any portion of a payment under this section would not (if made as a Separate payment) be deemed a qualified sponsorship payment under IRC § 513(i), such portion shall be deemed and treated as separate from the qualified sponsorship payment.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Receipt of Payment</span>.  Sponsor must submit full payment in order to secure Sponsor Benefits.</li>

  <li><span class="item-title">Refunds</span>.  The PSF does not offer refunds for sponsorships.  The PSF may cancel the event(s) or any part thereof.

  <li><span class="item-title">Sponsor Benefits</span>.  Sponsor Benefits per the Agreement are:</li>
